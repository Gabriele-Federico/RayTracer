# Summary
My small ray tracer, this is a project to study ray tracing and computer graphics. I'm using the [Ray Tracing In One Weekend series](https://raytracing.github.io/) but changing some stuff about code structure and architecture.

# Project setup
To generate the project, you can use CMake. You can just use the command `cmake -G"your-generator"`, if you are under Windows and want to use Clang just run the `generate_project.bat`
